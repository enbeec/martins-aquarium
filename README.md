#Martin's Aquarium

## Todo List

- [ ] Styling Changes
	- Quotes need vertical space between them when stacked
- [ ] Text/Wording Changes
	- Fishes -> My Fish
	- get rid of quotes section title?
	- maybe move quotes title right and de-emphasize?
	- "Native Fish:" is ugly to me
- [ ] Code Cleanup
	- separate javascript by content type (see 3rd to last chapter)
	- organize
